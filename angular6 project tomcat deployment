In order to deploy angular6 projet in tomcat server, we must perform following steps.
Initialy I am facing few proble while building app with angular CLI, so I also mentiond those in this document.

Steps :
1) go to your projet folder
2) run "ng build --prod"
    if every thing is fine and project dependency is clear and all angular CLI installed and working find 
    then "dist" folder will be created and copy this "dist" folder to apache-tomcat\webapps\ folder and up the tomcat then open browser
          and type http:\\[ip:port]\dist\index.html
    else if you find this issue 
        ng-serve is not working - Could not find module "@angular-devkit/build-angular"
    then 
        Install @angular-devkit/build-angular as dev dependency. This package is newly introduced in Angular 6.0

        npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular
        or,
        yarn add @angular-devkit/build-angular --dev
        
    else if you find this issue
        You seem to not be depending on "@angular/core" and/or "rxjs". This is an error.
    then   
       run "npm link"
