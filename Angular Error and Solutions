Error 1 : error Unexpected end of JSON input while parsing near '...","methods":"1.1.0","'
Solution : 
   

Error 2 : Can't bind to 'ngModel' since it isn't a known property of 'input'. 

Solution : 
	import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
	and
	imports: [
		FormsModule
	]
	in main app.module.ts file
	
	Although ngModel is a valid Angular directive, it isn't available by default.
	It belongs to the optional FormsModule and you must opt-in to using it.
